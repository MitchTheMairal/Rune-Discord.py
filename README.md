## ***Update ~ May 2, 2021***
The Recreation of JSON as a Database in Python has been cancelled; Characters Feature has been cancelled.

## ***Update ~ May 7, 2021***
The Recreation of JSON as a Database in Python has been recontinued, and the reasons are:
* I've researched more and deep into the vast of internet.
* I figured out and found more tricks to make this as simple like Javascript.
* Started to study more about Classic Python.

## ***Update ~ June 12, 2021***
Rune is now finished, i still might update Rune, but for now i got to go finish my other projects.
